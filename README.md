# Hyperlinks Space Program

<u>**In progress, contribute!**</u>

This program is built upon [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) by Meta and [Expo](https://expo.dev) multiplatform technologies, Windows build and executable creation achieved with [Electron Builder](https://www.electron.build/) and [Electron Forge](https://www.electronforge.io/), working in Telegram with help of [Telegram Mini Apps React SDK](http://telegram-mini-apps.com/), [Bot API](https://core.telegram.org/bots) and [Grammy](https://grammy.dev/). AI is backed by [OpenAI API](https://openai.com/ru-RU/api/), blockchain info is processed from [Swap.Coffee API](https://docs.swap.coffee/eng/user-guides/welcome). DB for the best user's experience we host on [Neon](https://neon.tech/).

## How to fork and contribute?

1. Install GitHub CLI and authorize to GitHub from CLI for instant work

```
winget install --id GitHub.cli
gh auth login
```

2. Fork the repo, clone it and create a new branch and switch to it

```
gh repo fork https://github.com/HyperlinksSpace/HyperlinksSpaceBot.git --clone
git checkout -b new-branch-for-an-update
git switch -c new-branch-for-an-update
```

3. Make a commit (address unassigned issue or think yourself)

```
git add . # Stage changes on this branch
git commit -m "Describe your change" # Commit on this branch
```

3. After making a commit, make a pull request, gh tool will already know the upstream remote

```
gh pr create --title "My new PR" --body "It is my best PR"
```

4. For subsequent commits (sync `main`, create a fresh branch, and commit there)

```
git checkout main # Return to main
git fetch upstream # Fully sync with upstream main
git reset --hard upstream/main # Reset local main to upstream/main
git push origin main # Keep your fork main in sync too
git switch -c new-branch-for-next-update # Create and switch to a new feature branch
```

**Move in loops starting from the step 3.**

## Local deploy

`npm` package note: `.env.example` is included in the published package so you can use it as a reference for establishing your testing environment with `.env` file.

Before local deploy / cloud deploy, prepare these env-backed services:

1. **Neon PostgreSQL (`DATABASE_URL`)**
   - Create an account/project at [Neon](https://neon.tech/).
   - Create a database and copy the connection string.
   - Put it into `.env` as `DATABASE_URL=...`.
2. **OpenAI API (`OPENAI_API_KEY`)**
   - Create an account at [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/).
   - Create an API key in the API Keys page.
   - Put it into `.env` as `OPENAI_API_KEY=...`.
3. **Telegram bot token (`BOT_TOKEN`)**
   - In Telegram, open [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather), create a test bot with `/newbot`.
   - Copy the bot token and put it into `.env` as `BOT_TOKEN=...`.
4. **Vercel project envs (for comfortable deploy/testing)**
   - Create a [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) account and import this repository as a project.
   - In Project Settings -> Environment Variables, set at least:
     - `DATABASE_URL`
     - `OPENAI_API_KEY`
     - `BOT_TOKEN` (or `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`)
   - Pull envs locally when needed with `vercel env pull .env.local`.

Copy env template locally:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

To start the full local stack, run:

```bash
npm run start
```

This runs Expo dev server, the Telegram bot (polling mode), and local Vercel API (`vercel dev`).

After `npm run start`, you can test the app on real phones with Expo Go:

- Install **Expo Go** from Google Play (Android) or App Store (iOS).
- Make sure your phone and development machine are on the same network.
- Open Expo Go and scan the QR code shown in the terminal/Expo UI.
- The app will launch on the device and hot-reload on code changes.

Isolated/local run options:

- Expo only (no bot, no Vercel): `npm run start:expo`
- Bot only (polling mode): `npm run bot:local`
- Vercel API only: `npm run dev:vercel`

## GitHub Actions

Current Actions workflows include:

- [`Vercel Deploy Test`](./.github/workflows/vercel-deploy-test-envs.yml) - manual web deploy to Vercel.
- [`Electron Forge EXE Release`](./.github/workflows/electron-forge-exe-release.yml) - manual Windows release pipeline.
- [`Electron EXE Release`](./.github/workflows/electron-exe-release.yml) - manual Windows release pipeline.
- [`Lint errors check`](./.github/workflows/lint-errors-check.yml) - manual lint check.
- [`EXPO Publish`](./.github/workflows/expo-publish.yml) - manual OTA publish with EAS CLI.
- [`NPM Package Release`](./.github/workflows/npm-package-release.yml) - npm/GitHub Packages release workflow.

## Deploy to Vercel

From the repository root, deploy the static web build to Vercel production:

```bash
vercel --prod
```

Deploying from repository root makes this folder the project root, so `api/bot` is deployed and no Root Directory setting is needed. The project is configured so Vercel runs `npx expo export -p web` and serves the `dist/` output. Link the project first with `vercel` if needed.

## Telegram bot

The bot is extended beyond a basic "Hello" and "Start program" responder and now supports AI streaming and threads.

**Vercel (webhook)**  
- **Runtime path:** Telegram sends updates to `POST /api/bot`. This route proxies to the shared bot webhook handler in `bot/webhook`.
- **Webhook setup:** `scripts/set-webhook.ts` sets `https://<base>/api/bot` using `VERCEL_PROJECT_PRODUCTION_URL` (preferred) or `VERCEL_URL`.
- **Required env:** set `BOT_TOKEN` (or `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`) in Vercel project envs for production deploys.
- **Deploy flow:** webhook mode is intended for Vercel deploys (CLI `vercel --prod` or the manual GitHub Action `Vercel Deploy (Test Envs)`).

**Bot works locally but not on Vercel**  
1. Confirm Vercel env has `BOT_TOKEN` and redeploy.
2. Ensure the deployed URL is stable and matches the webhook target (`/api/bot`).
3. Check deploy/runtime logs for `[set-webhook]` and `[webhook]` errors.
4. Do not run local polling with the same token while validating webhook mode.

**Local (getUpdates, no webhook)**  
- Only `BOT_TOKEN` is required (env or `.env`).
- Run bot only: `npm run bot:local`
- Run full local stack (Expo + bot + Vercel): `npm run start`
- Keep production and local bot tokens separate when possible to avoid webhook/polling conflicts.

## Pull requests and commits requirements

- Give pull requests and commits a proper name and description
- Dedicate each pull request to an understandable area or field, each commit to a focused logical change
- Check file changes in every commit pulled, no arbitrary files modifications should persist such as LF/CRLF line-ending conversion, broken/garbled text diffs, BOM added or removed, accidental "invisible" corruption from text filters
- Add dependecies and packages step by step for security
- An issue creation or following an existing before a pull request would be a good practice

## Expo Workflows

[EAS Workflows](https://docs.expo.dev/eas/workflows/get-started/) are here for Expo update/build/deploy flows (triggered via npm scripts from [`package.json`](./package.json)).

## Previews

Run `npm run draft` to [publish a preview update](https://docs.expo.dev/eas/workflows/examples/publish-preview-update/) of your project, which can be viewed in Expo Go or in a development build.

## Development Builds

Run `npm run development-builds` to [create a development build](https://docs.expo.dev/eas/workflows/examples/create-development-builds/). Note - you'll need to follow the [Prerequisites](https://docs.expo.dev/eas/workflows/examples/create-development-builds/#prerequisites) to ensure you have the correct emulator setup on your machine.

## Expo envs setup

**Expo app** – `npx expo start` reads env from the environment; for app-only env vars you can also put them in `.env` and use an Expo-compatible loader if you add one, or set them in the shell before running:
   ```bash
   export BOT_TOKEN=your_token
   npx expo start
   ```

## GitLab access

GitHub and GitLab repositories are identical. If you want to contribute through GitLab, get access from [@staindart](https://github.com/staindart).

If you can push to **both** [GitHub](https://github.com/HyperlinksSpace/HyperlinksSpaceProgram) and [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/hyperlinks.space/HyperlinksSpaceProgram) directly, we ask you to configure Git so pushes keep **both** hosts in sync: the repositories are the same; avoid updating only one side.

1. **Keep `origin` on GitHub for fetch and the first push URL.** If you cloned from GitHub, this is already true: `origin` is where `git pull` / `git fetch origin` get updates. We standardize on GitHub for **incoming** history from `origin` so your local `main` tracks `origin/main` on GitHub.

2. **Register GitLab as a second push URL on `origin`.** Git allows multiple **push** URLs per remote name, but only one **fetch** URL. Adding GitLab here means a single `git push origin <branch>` (or the IDE **Sync** push step) sends the same commits to **both** GitHub and GitLab without a second command.

   ```bash
   git remote set-url --add --push origin https://gitlab.com/hyperlinks.space/HyperlinksSpaceProgram.git
   ```

   Run this once per clone; it does not change where you fetch from.

3. **Add a separate remote named `gitlab`.** Because `origin`’s fetch URL stays on GitHub, `git fetch origin` never downloads refs from GitLab. The extra remote lets you run `git fetch gitlab` when you need to compare or merge with the GitLab copy (for example if CI or another contributor updated GitLab only).

   ```bash
   git remote add gitlab https://gitlab.com/hyperlinks.space/HyperlinksSpaceProgram.git
   ```

   Note, that GitHub and GitLab URL's are a little different :)

   If `gitlab` already exists with a wrong URL, use `git remote set-url gitlab https://gitlab.com/hyperlinks.space/HyperlinksSpaceProgram.git` instead.

4. **Verify** with `git remote -v`. You should see GitHub on fetch/push for `origin`, GitLab as the second `origin` push line, and `gitlab` for fetch/push to GitLab:

   ```text
   gitlab  https://gitlab.com/hyperlinks.space/HyperlinksSpaceProgram.git (fetch)
   gitlab  https://gitlab.com/hyperlinks.space/HyperlinksSpaceProgram.git (push)
   origin  https://github.com/HyperlinksSpace/HyperlinksSpaceProgram.git (fetch)
   origin  https://github.com/HyperlinksSpace/HyperlinksSpaceProgram.git (push)
   origin  https://gitlab.com/hyperlinks.space/HyperlinksSpaceProgram.git (push)
   ```

**GitLab HTTPS access:** GitLab.com does not use **fine-grained** personal access tokens for Git-over-HTTPS (`git push` / `git fetch`). Create a **legacy** personal access token under GitLab → **Edit profile** → **Access tokens** with scopes **`read_repository`** and **`write_repository`**, as described in the official guide: [Personal access tokens](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html). Use your GitLab username and the token as the password when Git prompts. GitHub authentication stays separate (for example `gh auth login` or your existing GitHub credential).

## Program Kit

To make it easier for developers to create multiplatform programs with us, we decided to launch an npm package that provides a ready starter for creating such a program basis in one command.

```bash
npx @www.hyperlinks.space/program-kit ./new-program
```

Link to the package: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@www.hyperlinks.space/program-kit

The **npm registry page** shows a separate package-oriented description: [`npmReadMe.md`](./npmReadMe.md) in the repo root. At publish time the [NPM Package Release](.github/workflows/npm-package-release.yml) workflow copies the main [`README.md`](./README.md) to `fullREADME.md`, then replaces `README.md` with the contents of `npmReadMe.md` so `npm pack` / `npm publish` ship the shorter readme as the package readme (npm always surfaces `README.md` from the tarball). Snapshot channels, tags, and local `npm pack` checks are in [`docs/npm-release.md`](./docs/npm-release.md).
